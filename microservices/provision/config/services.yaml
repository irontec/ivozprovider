# This file is the entry point to configure your own services.

parameters:

services:
    # default configuration for services in *this* file
    _defaults:
        autowire: true      # Automatically injects dependencies in your services.
        autoconfigure: true # Automatically registers your services as commands, event subscribers, etc.
        public: false       # Allows optimizing the container by removing unused services; this also means
                            # fetching services directly from the container via $container->get() won't work.
                            # The best practice is to be explicit about your dependencies anyway.

    IndexController:
        class: "IndexController"
        public: true
    # add more service definitions when explicit configuration is needed
    # please note that last definitions always *replace* previous ones
