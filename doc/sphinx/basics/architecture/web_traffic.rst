HTTPS is the third traffic type exchanged between IvozProvider and *external
world*.

HTTPS traffic is used for:

- **Terminal provisioning**: several hardphones ask for their configuration when
  they wake up and this configuration files can be served through HTTPS.

- **Web portals**: IvozProvider has 4-level web portals for all the
  :ref:`platform roles <operation_roles>`.

  Both of these traffics are handled by *Web portals* IvozProvider entity.
