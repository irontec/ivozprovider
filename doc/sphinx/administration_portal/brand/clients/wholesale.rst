Wholesale
*********

Wholesale clients are the simplest client type in IvozProvider.

It allows trunking services with Carriers without any application server features,
focusing on concurrency and quality rather on having lots of services.


    - Just make outgoing calls.

    - IP authentication only (no register, no SIP auth).

    - Calls go directly from users to trunks, without any application server involved.

    - Support for routing tags (client can choose the outgoing route to use)

    - Support for audio transcoding.

.. warning:: No users, no extensions, no internal calls, no DDIs, no voicemail, no call forwards...
    just **outgoing external calls**.

.. error:: Wholesale clients **do not need to use Brand's SIP domain in their SIP messages**.
