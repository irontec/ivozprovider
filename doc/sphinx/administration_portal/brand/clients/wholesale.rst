Wholesale
*********

Wholesale clients are the simplest client type in IvozProvider.

It allows trunking services with Carriers without any application server features,
focusing on concurrency and quality rather on having lots of services.


    - Just make outgoing calls.

    - IP authentication only (no register, no SIP auth).

    - Calls go directly from users to trunks, without any application server involved.

    - Support for routing tags (client can choose the outgoing route to use)

    - Support for audio transcoding.

.. warning:: No users, no extensions, no internal calls, no DDIs, no voicemail, no call forwards...
    just **outgoing external calls**.

.. error:: Wholesale clients **do not need to use Brand's SIP domain in their SIP messages**.

Adding/Editing clients
----------------------

.. hint:: Some fields described below may not be visible depending on enabled features.

These are the fields shown when **adding** a new wholesale client:

    Name
        Used to reference this particular client.

    Billing method
        To choose among postpaid, prepaid and pseudo-prepaid. 'none' disables billing.

    Language
        Used to choose the language of played locutions.

    Default timezone
        Used for showing call registries dates.

    Currency
        Chosen currency will be used in price calculation, invoices, balance movements and
        remaining money operations of this client.

    Numeric transformation
        Describes the way the client will "talk" and the way the client wants to be "talked".

    Max calls
        Limits outgoing external calls (0 for unlimited).

    Max daily usage
        Limits external outbound calls when this limit is reached within a day. At midnight counters are reset and
        accounts are re-enabled.

    Email
        A notification email will be sent to given address when configured max daily usage is reached. Leave empty to
        avoid notification.

When **editing** a client, these additional fields can be configured:

    Invoice data
        All the fields in this group will be included in invoices generated for this client. This section also allows
        showing/hiding billing details to client's portal, such as Invoices, Rating Profiles and Price of external calls.

    Routing tags
        This field allows enabling routing tags for this specific client. Call preceded with this
        routing tags will be rated and routed differently.

    Audio transcoding
        This field allows enabling codecs for this specific client. This codecs will be added to
        the ones offered by the client in its SDP.

.. error:: Selecting codecs in **Audio transcoding** may lead to uneeded transcoding. Selecting ALL codecs is
           always a horrible idea. Do not select any codec unless this client does not support an specific codec
           that is compulsory for a needed destination/carrier.

.. note:: Apart from these fields, main operator (*aka* God) will also see a **Platform data** group that allows:

    - Choosing an specific media relay set for the client.

Each entry in this table has these additional options:

- **List of authorized sources**: client identification will be made looking up the source IP address in this table.

- **List of client admins**: this subsection allows managing portal credentials for this specific client. Read :ref:`acls`
  for further explanation about restricted client administrators.

- **List of rating profiles**: this subsection allows managing the rating profiles that will be used to bill its outgoing calls.

.. warning:: No outgoing call will be allowed for this client unless an active rating profiles that can
             bill the specific call.
