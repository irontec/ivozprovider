        another logo).

        Introduced in 1.4. Domain pointing to Users SIP proxy used by all the
        Retail Accounts and Residential Devices of this brand.

    Recordings
        Configures a limit for the size of recordings of this brand. A
        notification is sent to configured address when 80% is reached and
        older recordings are rotated when configured size is reached.

    Features
        Introduced in 1.3, lets god operator choose the features of the created
        brand. An equivalent configuration is available in Clients, to choose
        between the ones that god operator gave to your Brand. Related sections
        are hidden consequently.

        Limits both user generated and **external** received calls to this value
        (0 for unlimited).

    Locales
        Define default Timezone, Language and Currency for clients of this brand.

.. hint:: Some features are related to brand and cannot be assigned to clients.
    Other ones are also related to clients and lets the brand operator to
    assign them to its clients.

.. warning:: Disabling billing hides all related sections and assumes that an
    external element will set a price for calls (external tarification
    module is needed, ask for it!).

.. note:: Disabling invoices hides related sections, assuming you will use an
    external tool to generate them.

.. note:: SIP domain is only visible for Brands with Retail or Residential features
    enabled.

Brand operators
---------------

**List of brand operators** subsection allows adding/editing/deleting credentials for brand portal access.


Brand Portals
-------------

**List of brand portals** subsection allows managing URLs to access to the different web portals available for a given brand.

See :ref:`Client Portals` for further reference.

.. warning:: URLs are assigned to brands. This means that through a given URL the brand can be guessed, but not the client.
             As a result, username collision domain will be at brand level (there cannot exist to client administrators
             with the same username within a brand).
