Retail Accounts
###############

Retail Accounts are the main routable option in Retail clients.
More or less like :ref:`friends` are to Virtual PBX Clients, devices
contain the required configurable options to provide a SIP connectivity
service with IvozProvider and an external SIP entity.

.. warning:: Although both **Carriers/DDI Providers** and **Retail Accounts** are defined by the
             **brand operator**, the former are designed to connect with the public switched telephony network
             while the latter connects the system with our clients' SIP entities.

Types of retail accounts
========================

There are 2 main types of SIP endpoints that can use retail with IvozProvider:

- **Direct connection endpoint**: IvozProvider must be able to talk SIP directly with
  this kind of devices by just forwarding the traffic to the proper port of
  the public IP address of the PBX.

- **Endpoint behind NAT**: Not directly reachable. This kind of endpoint must register at
  IvozProvider (just like all the :ref:`Terminals <terminals>` do).

What kind of calls can be routed through a *Retail Account*?
============================================================

Contrary to Friends, **Retail Accounts** have some simplifications and limitations:

    - Retail Accounts only route their assigned DDIs
    - Retail Accounts only place externals calls to Carriers
    - Retail Accounts only receive external calls from DDI Providers

Retail Accounts Configuration
=============================

These are the configurable settings of *Retail accounts*:

.. glossary::

    Name
        Name of the **retail account**. This name must be unique in the whole brand so 
        it's recommended to use some kind of sequential identifier. This will also be used
        in SIP messages (sent **From User**).

    Description
        Optional. Extra information for this *retail account*.

    Password
        When the *retail account* send requests, IvozProvider will authenticate it using
        this password. Like remaining SIP entities in IvozProvider (except Wholesale) **using password IS MANDATORY**.

    Direct connectivity
        If you choose 'Yes' here, you'll have to fill the protocol, address and
        port where this *retail account* can be contacted.

    Numeric transformation
        Numeric transformation set that will be applied when communicating with this device.

    Fallback Outgoing DDI
        External calls from this *retail account* will be presented with this DDI, **unless
        the source presented matches a DDI belonging to the retail account**.

    From domain
        Request from IvozProvider to this account will include this domain in
        the From header.

    DDI In
        If set to 'Yes', use endpoint username in R-URI when calling this retail account. If set to 'No', use called
        number instead.

.. warning:: All retail accounts within a retail client will have the transcoding capabilities configured at client level.

.. tip:: On retail account edit screen **id** field shows internal identification number assigned to the retail account.
         This id is transported to *Endpoint Id* field in *Billable Calls* section for CSV export.


Voicemail settings
==================

There is no voicemail service for retail clients.

Call forwarding settings
========================

Each retail account can have a unique enabled call forward setting, pointing to an external number.

This external called will be called whenever the retail account cannot be reached:

- Direct connectivity accounts: when no answer is received from defined address.

- Accounts using SIP register: when no answer is received from last contact address or when no active register is found.

Asterisk as a retail account
============================

At the other end of a account can be any kind of SIP entity. This section takes
as example an Asterisk PBX system using SIP channel driver that wants to connect
to IvozProvider.

Account register
----------------

If the system can not be directly access, Asterisk will have to register in the
platform (like a terminal will do).

Configuration will be something like this:

.. code-block:: none

    register => account-name:account-password@ivozprovider-brand.sip-domain.com

Account peer
------------

.. code-block:: none

    [name-peer]
    type=peer
    host=ivozprovider-brand.sip-domain.com
    context=XXXXXX
    disallow=all
    allow=alaw
    defaultuser=account-name
    secret=account-password
    fromdomain=ivozprovider-brand.sip-domain.com
    insecure=port,invite
    sendrpid=pai

.. warning:: *Retail accounts* MUST NOT challenge IvozProvider. That's
             why the *insecure* setting is used here.

.. note:: As from username is used to identify the retail account, P-Asserted-Identity must be used to specify caller number.
