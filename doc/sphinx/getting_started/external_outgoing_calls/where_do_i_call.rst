Where do I call?
################

At this point of the configuration, we have to configure IvozProvider to use the
already configured *Contract Peering* to place the external calls we are making.

To achieve this, in first place, we need that the dialed external numbers fall
in an existing **target pattern**.

.. toctree::

    /brand/routing/patterns
    /brand/routing/pattern_groups


To achieve our goal of making an external call to a spanish number, we didn't have
to modify the initial contents of this two sections :)
