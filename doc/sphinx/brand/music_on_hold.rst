Generic Music on Hold
#####################

:ref:`Music on Hold` will be played when the user holds the call and the other
member waits until the call is resumed. 

If a company has defined a music on hold, it will be played. Otherwise, the
one defined by the brand administrator in this section. If none of this is configured,
a global music will be played.

.. note:: Multiple files can be added to be played as Music on Hold. The system 
    will choose them randomly for each call.
