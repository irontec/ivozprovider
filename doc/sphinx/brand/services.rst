The section **Brand configuration** > **Services** allows the brand operator to:

- Change the default service code for all the brand companies (assuming the
  company hasn't already customized the code)

- Delete services so it won't be available for the companies.

By default this list has all the services and codes from the global
configuration:

.. attention:: This section lists the available services and the default codes
   when a **new company** is created.

.. hint:: Changing the default code in this section will only affect new
   created companies.
