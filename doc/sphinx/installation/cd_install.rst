As mentioned in :ref:`Minimum requirements` is required at least one public IP
address for User and Trunk SIP proxies. Remember that if you use only one,
KamTrunks will use different SIP ports to avoid collision.

You can set its addresses right now and configure the interfaces properly when
the system is fully installed. This menu can be displayed anytime after the
installation.

You can also configure default root MySQL password right now.

.. note:: If you don't configure MySQL password, default password will be used
   (changeme). You can still change it later.

And default language for portals:

   installation. In case any setting has been left without configuration a
   warning dialog will be displayed.

After the reboot, you are ready to access using the web portals!

   installation will work to acces the web portal. Default credentials are
   **admin / changeme**.
