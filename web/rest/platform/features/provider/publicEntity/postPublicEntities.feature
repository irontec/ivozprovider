    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/public_entities" with body:
      """
      {
          "iden": "Destinations",
          "fqdn": "Ivoz\\Provider\\Domain\\Model\\Destination\\Destination",
          "platform": true,
          "brand": true,
          "client": false,
          "name": {
              "en": "Destinations",
              "es": "Destinations",
              "ca": "Destinations",
              "it": "Destinations"
