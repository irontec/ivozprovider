  @createSchema
  Scenario: Remove a media relay sets
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Remove default media relay sets
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "DELETE" request to "/media_relay_sets/0"
     Then the response status code should be 403
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/problem+json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be like:

      {
        "detail": "Rejected request during security check"
      }
      """
