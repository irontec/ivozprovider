Feature: Create brand servers
  In order to manage brand services
  as a super admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create an brand services
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/brand_services" with body:
      """
      {
          "code": "11",
          "brand": 1,
          "service": 4
      }
      """
     Then the response status code should be 201
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      {
          "code": "11",
          "id": 5,
          "brand": 1,
          "service": 4
      }
      """

  Scenario: Retrieve created brand service
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "GET" request to "brand_services/5"
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be like:
      """
      {
          "code": "11",
