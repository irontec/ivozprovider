## 2.16.3
* Added new string search filter modifiers:
    - start: Starts with
    - end: Ends with
    - exact: Exact match
    - partial: Contains

These modifiers are incompatible with modifierless search parameters. For instance,
if you are using "email=partial_domain" (partial search) and you want to append some [starts] filter
you'll need to replace the former criteria by "email[partial]=partial_domain&email[start]=abc". Modifierless
string search parameters are now deprecated and they'll be removed on next major relesase.
