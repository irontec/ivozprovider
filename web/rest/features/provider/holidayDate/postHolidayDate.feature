Feature: Create holiday dates
  In order to manage holiday dates
  As an super admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a holiday date
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/holiday_dates" with body:
    """
      {
          "name": "New",

          "locution": 1
      }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 201
     And the response should be in JSON
     And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
