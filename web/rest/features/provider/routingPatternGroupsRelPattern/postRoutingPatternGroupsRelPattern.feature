  As an super admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  Scenario: Create a routing pattern groups rel pattern
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/routing_pattern_groups_rel_patterns" with body:

     And the response should be in JSON
