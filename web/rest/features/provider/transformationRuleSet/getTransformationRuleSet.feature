Feature: Retrieve transformation rule sets
  In order to manage transformation rule sets
  As an super admin
  I need to be able to retrieve them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Retrieve the transformation rule sets json list
    Given I add Authorization header
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "GET" request to "transformation_rule_sets"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
