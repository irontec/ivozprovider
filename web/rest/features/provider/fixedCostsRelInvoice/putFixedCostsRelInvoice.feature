Feature: Update fixed costs rel invoices
  In order to manage fixed costs rel invoices
  As an super admin
  I need to be able to update them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Update a fixed cost rel invoice
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "PUT" request to "/fixed_costs_rel_invoices/1" with body:
    """
      {
          "quantity": 2,
          "id": 1,
          "fixedCost": 1,
          "invoice": 1
      }
    """
    Then the response status code should be 200
     And the response should be in JSON
     And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
     And the JSON should be like:
    """
      {
          "quantity": 2,
          "id": 1,
          "fixedCost": {
              "name": "Monitoring",
              "description": "Something",
              "cost": "1",
              "id": 1,
              "brand": 1
          },
          "invoice": {
              "number": "1",
