  In order to manage external call filter rel calendars
  As an super admin
  I need to be able to update them through the API.

  Scenario: Update an external call filter rel calendar
    Given I add Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "PUT" request to "/external_call_filter_rel_calendars/1" with body:
    """
      {
          "id": 1,
          "filter": 1,
          "calendar": 2
