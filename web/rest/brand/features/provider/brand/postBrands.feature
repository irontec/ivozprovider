Feature: Manage brands
  In order to manage brands
  As a brand admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Cannot create brands
    Given I add Brand Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/brands" with body:
      """
      {
        "name": "api_brand",
        "defaultTimezone": 1
      }
      """
     Then the response status code should be 405
