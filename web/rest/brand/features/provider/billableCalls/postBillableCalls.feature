  Scenario: Can not create billable calls
    Given I add Brand Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/billable_calls" with body:
      """
      {}
      """
