Feature: Create fixed costs rel invoice schedulers
  In order to manage fixed costs rel invoice schedulers
  As a brand admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a fixed cost rel invoice scheduler
    Given I add Brand Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/fixed_costs_rel_invoice_schedulers" with body:
      """
      {

          "fixedCost": 2,
          "invoiceScheduler": 1
      }
      """
     Then the response status code should be 201
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
