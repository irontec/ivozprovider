Feature: Manage banned addresses
  In order to manage banned addresses
  as a super admin
  I need to be able to retrieve them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Retrieve the banned address json list
    Given I add Brand Authorization header
     When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "GET" request to "banned_addresses"
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      [
          {
              "ip": "8.8.8.8",
              "blocker": "ipfilter",
