Feature: Retrieve carriers
  In order to manage carriers
  As an super admin
  I need to be able to retrieve them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Retrieve the carriers json list
    Given I add Brand Authorization header
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "GET" request to "carriers"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
      [
          {
              "description": "CarrierDescription",
              "name": "CarrierName",

              "id": 1
          }
