Feature: Retrieve outgoing ddi rules
  In order to manage outgoing ddi rules
  As a brand admin
  I need to be able to retrieve them through the API.

  Scenario: Retrieve the outgoing ddi rules json list
    Given I add Brand Authorization header
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "GET" request to "outgoing_ddi_rules"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
