Feature: Update hunt groups rel users
  In order to manage hunt groups rel users
  As a client admin
  I need to be able to update them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Update a hunt group rel user
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "PUT" request to "/hunt_group_members/1" with body:
      """
      {
          "timeoutTime": 2,
          "priority": 10,
          "routeType": "user",
          "id": 1,
          "huntGroup": 1,
          "user": 1
      }
      """
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      {
           "timeoutTime": 2,
           "priority": 10,
           "routeType": "user",
           "numberValue": null,
           "id": 1,
           "huntGroup": 1,
           "user": 1,
           "numberCountry": null
       }
      """
