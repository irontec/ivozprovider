  As a client admin
  I need to be able to update them through the API.

  Scenario: Update an conditional routes
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "PUT" request to "/conditional_routes/1" with body:
      """
      {
          "name": "testUpdate",
          "routetype": "number",
          "numbervalue": "946002021",
          "friendvalue": "",
          "id": 1,
          "ivr": null,
          "huntGroup": null,
          "voicemail": null,
          "user": null,
          "queue": null,
          "locution": null,
          "conferenceRoom": null,
          "extension": null,
          "numberCountry": 68
      }
      """
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      {
