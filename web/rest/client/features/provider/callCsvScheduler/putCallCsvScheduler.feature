Feature: Update call CSV scheduler
  In order to manage call CSV scheduler
  As a client admin
  I need to be able to update them through the API.

  Scenario: Update a call CSV scheduler
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "PUT" request to "/call_csv_schedulers/2   " with body:
      """
       {
          "name": "updated name",
          "unit": "week",
          "frequency": 1,
          "callDirection": "outbound",

          "ddi": 1,
          "retailAccount": null,
          "residentialDevice": null
      }
      """

      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
