Feature: Create conditional routes conditions route lock
  In order to manage conditional routes conditions route lock
  As a client admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create an conditional routes conditions rel schedule
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "/conditional_routes_conditions_rel_route_locks" with body:

      {

          "routeLock": 2
      }
      """
     Then the response status code should be 201
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
