Feature: Retrieve conference rooms
  In order to manage conference rooms
  As a client admin
  I need to be able to retrieve them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Retrieve the conference rooms json list
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "GET" request to "conference_rooms"
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      [
          {
              "name": "testConferenceRoom",
              "pinProtected": true,
              "pinCode": "4321",
              "maxMembers": 1,
              "id": 1
          }
      ]
      """
