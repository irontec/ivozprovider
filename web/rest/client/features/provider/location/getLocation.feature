Feature: Retrieve locations
  In order to manage locations
  As a client admin
  I need to be able to retrieve them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Retrieve the locations json list
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "GET" request to "locations"
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      [
          {
              "name": "testLocation",
              "description": "Test Location description",
              "id": 1
          }
      ]
      """

  Scenario: Retrieve certain locations json
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "GET" request to "locations/1"
     Then the response status code should be 200
      And the response should be in JSON
      And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
      And the JSON should be equal to:
      """
      {
