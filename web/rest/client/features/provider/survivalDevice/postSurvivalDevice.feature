Feature: Create a survival device
  In order to manage survival devices
  As a client admin
  I need to be able to create them through the API.

  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a survival devices
    Given I add Company Authorization header
     When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/json"
      And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
      And I send a "POST" request to "survival_devices" with body:
      """
      {
        "name": "Survival Test 1",
        "proxy": "23123",
