  Scenario: Retrieve company total active calls json
    Given I add Company Authorization header
    When I add "Accept" header equal to "application/json"
    And I send a "GET" request to "my/active_calls"
    Then the response status code should be 200
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    And the JSON should be equal to:
    """
      {
          "inbound": 1,
          "outbound": 1,
          "total": 2
      }
    """
