Where do I call?
################

At this point of the configuration, we have to configure IvozProvider to use the
already configured *Carrier* to place the external calls we are making.

To achieve this, in first place, we need that the dialed external numbers fall
in an existing **target pattern**:

- :ref:`Routing patterns`
- :ref:`Routing pattern groups`

.. tip:: To achieve our goal of making an external call to a spanish number, we didn't have
         to modify the initial contents of this two sections as Spain pattern already exists :)
