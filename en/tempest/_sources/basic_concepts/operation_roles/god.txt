The global administrator role (operator in the image) is usually done by
the installation responsible.

All options and platform features are visible to this role and usually is
in charge of its maintenance.

Their most important task is to **create Brands** and configure them so
they have the enough autonomy to properly use the platform:

    - Configure their web access.

    - Configure their brand portal look and feel: themes, colors, etc.

Apart from their main task, their global visibility and total access
makes them responsible of:

- Monitor the platform so it keeps always UP & RUNNING

- Analyze platform logs to track possible errors.

- Polish the security mechanisms to avoid external attacks.

- Obtain global statistics of calls audio quality.

- Increase the available resources of the platform as long as is needed:

    - Increasing resources available in a standalone installation

    - Migrating, whenever required, to a distributed installation with multiple
      AS, media relays, etc.

To sum up, **this role is the only one that has no limits within the
platform**, that's why *God* is a term used in multiple places along this
documentation.

.. important:: *This role is responsible of maintaining the platform**, configuring
               it for the correct behaviour. This role **doesn't have any kind
               of limit** and **grants access** to the **brand operators**.
