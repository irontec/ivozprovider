Retail DDI routes

Retail DDIs can only be routed to a :ref:`Retail Accounts <retail_accounts>`

.. hint:: Routing a DDI through a Retail account will allow to place external calls
    from that account presenting that DDI as origin.

If Retail Client has *Recordings* feature enabled, DDIs can also record incoming and/or
outgoing calls.
