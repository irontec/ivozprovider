Peering configuration
*********************

We understand a **Peering contract** the agreement between a **Brand Operator**
and a VoIP Provider to make and receive calls.

We divide Peerings in two types:

- **Carriers** for outgoing calls (see :ref:`Carriers`).

- **DDI Providers** for incoming calls (see :ref:`DDI Providers`).

In order to achieve our goal, we will need to create a new (an valid) DDI Provider assign our country's
numeric transformation. See :ref:`DDI Providers` for further reference.
