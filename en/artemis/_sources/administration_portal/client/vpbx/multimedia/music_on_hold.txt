Music on Hold
#############

The music on hold will be played when the user holds the call and the other 
member waits until the call is resumed. 

If a client has defined a music on hold, it will be played. Otherwise, the
one defined by the brand administrator. If none of this is configured, a global 
music will be played.

.. note:: Multiple files can be added to be played as Music on Hold. The system 
   will choose them randomly for each call. 

.. rubric:: Add a new music on hold


Once the music has been *encoded* the **Status** fill will display *ready* and 
the music will be used for the next calls.


.. tip:: IvozProvider supports most of the common audio formats and *encodes* 
   them to the optimal format for the platform. 

After the *encoding*, we can download both the original and the converted 
version in the edit screen.
