Retail clients are a special type of company that only provide a connectivity
service with contract peerings through retail accounts.

.. attention:: Contrary to the Virtual PBX companies, all Retail clients use the 
    brand domain to unequivocally identify their accounts. You'll need to configure
    Brand's domain to use this feature.

.. hint:: Retail clients can be enabled per Brand basis via Features.

The goal of this section will be describe each of the configuration settings
associated with Retail clients included in IvozProvider.
