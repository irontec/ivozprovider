The company administrator has access to the portal supplied by the brand
operator.

From its point of view, it has a virtual pbx in the cloud that must
configure for its users.

To accomplish that, it's required:

- Configure terminals, extensions and users.

- Configure the DDI incoming process with the proper logic:

    - Directly to an user
    - IVRs
    - Hunt groups
    - Faxes

- Give access to the final users to their web portal, so they can configure
  their profile options:

    - Call forward
    - Do not disturb
    - Call waiting

.. important:: To sum up, the company administrators are resposible for
               **configuring the telephony system and make use of all the
               features available in IvozProvider**.
