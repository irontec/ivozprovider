Hunt groups

The hungroups allows configuring more complex *ringing* process that the 
traditional **call to a user**.

There are multiple types:

.. glossary::

    Ring all
        The call will make all the terminals of the group during a predefined 
        time.

    Sequential
        The call will *jump* from one user to another in a predefined order
        ringing during the configured time. If the call is not answered by any 
        user of the group, it will be hanguped (or trigger the no answer logic).

    Sequential (infinite)
        The call will *jump* from one user to another in a predefined order 
        ringing during the configured time. If the call is not answered by any
        user of the group, the call will *jump* again to the first member of the 
        group and keep looping.  

    Random
        The call will *jump* from one user to another in a random order, 
        ringing during the configured time.  If the call is not answered by any 
        user of the group, it will be hanguped (or trigger the no answer logic).

.. rubric:: Example 1: *Ringall* hunt group

The following example will show how to create a hunt group that will call our 2 
users at the same time during 30 seconds: 

.. image:: img/huntgroup_add.png

Pressing the proper icon, we can add Alice and Bob to the hunt group: 

.. image:: img/huntgroup_add2.png

.. rubric:: Example 2: *Sequential* hunt group 

We will edit the hunt group to convert it into sequential: the call will ring 
Alice during 10 seconds, then it will ring Bob 15 seconds, repeting this process
until one of them answers.

For this type of groups we have to configure priority (the call will *jump* 
from the users with lower number priority to the ones with higher number 
priority) and a *ringing* time for each user.

.. hint:: Hunt groups can be routed from any process of IvozProvider by simply
   adding an extension that route to them.

Let's create a new extension that routes to this hunt group:

.. hint:: When configuring a huntgroup, you can prevent missed calls on called members with **Prevent missed calls** setting:

   - **Yes**: calls generated by the huntgroup will never generate missed calls on called members.

   - **No**: The behaviour of this setting depends on the huntgroup type:

     - **RingAll**: calls generated by the huntgroup will generate missed calls on called members only if none of them answers the call.

     - **Remaining types**: calls generated by the huntgroup will generate missed calls on every called member that does not answer the call.
