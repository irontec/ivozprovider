Company Configuration
*********************

We're close to make our fist call in our fresh installed IvozProvider, there
are only 6 steps to configure in our DemoCompany company.

- 2 terminals
- 2 extensions
- 2 users

Creating Terminals
==================

Go to the terminal section and... voil√†! We already have 2 terminals created:

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

    .. image:: img/en/terminals.png

.. ifconfig:: language == 'es'

    .. image:: img/es/terminals.png

Creating Extensions
===================

Then we go to extensions, just to check that we have 2 extensions already
created for us:

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

    .. image:: img/en/extensions.png

.. ifconfig:: language == 'es'

    .. image:: img/es/extensions.png

Nothing more to do in this section, let's go the next one!

Creating Users
==============

As expected, we also have 2 created users:

.. ifconfig:: language == 'en'

    .. image:: img/en/users.png

.. ifconfig:: language == 'es'

    .. image:: img/es/users.png

At this point, we have everthing ready make a call between this two users:
Alice and Bob.
