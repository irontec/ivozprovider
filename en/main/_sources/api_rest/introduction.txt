Introduction to IvozProvider API
################################

Ivoz Provider offers three `hypermedia <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS>`_-driven REST APIs, one for each admin role. The three of them have been built over
`OpenAPI Specification <https://www.openapis.org/>`_, a community-driven open specification within the OpenAPI
Initiative, a Linux Foundation Collaborative Project. This initiative is supported by some leading tech companies
such as Adobe, Google, IBM, Microsoft and `more <https://www.openapis.org/membership/members)>`_.

 - Nice human-readable specification, including a sandbox
 - JSON Web Token (JWT) based authentication
 - Request and response content type negotiation
 - Result pagination
 - Response property filters
 - Result filters
 - Result ordering
 - Security layer: Resource and record access control
