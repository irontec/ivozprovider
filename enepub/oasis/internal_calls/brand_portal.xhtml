<h1>Brand Configuration</h1>
<p>We need that the default DemoBrand have a company with at least 2 users. In
order to archive this we will require little configuration in this section.</p>
<p>In fact, if we check <strong>Companies</strong> in the brand menu, we&#8217;ll discover that there
is already an existing <em>DemoCompany</em> that we can use to fulfill our desired
goal :)</p>
<img alt="../_images/company_list.png" src="../_images/company_list.png" />
<p>Only a thing is required to configure for this company, marked as edit in the
previous image.</p>
<div class="section" id="company-sip-domain">
<span id="domain-per-company"></span><h2>Company SIP Domain</h2>
<p>As mentioned in the previous section, is <strong>required</strong> that each of the companies
have a public domain that resolves to the configured IP address for
<a class="reference internal" href="god_portal.xhtml#proxyusers"><span class="std std-ref">Users SIP Proxy</span></a>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">DNS register can be type A (supported by all the hardphones/softphones
) or even NAPTR+SRV.</p>
</div>
<p>Once the domain has been configured (by means that are out of scope of this
document), it will be enought to write it in our company configuration:</p>
<img alt="../_images/set_domain.png" src="../_images/set_domain.png" />
<p>Once the company has been saved, the domain will be also displayed in the list
<a class="reference internal" href="god_portal.xhtml#god-sipdomains"><span class="std std-ref">previously mentioned</span></a>:</p>
<img alt="../_images/domain_list.png" src="../_images/domain_list.png" />

<p class="last">It&#8217;s important to understand this block. <a class="reference internal" href="#dnshack"><span class="std std-ref">Unless we&#8217;ve a
single company registered</span></a>, wihout a DNS domain pointing to our
users proxy IP address, everything will fail.</p>
</div>
<p>This is a good sign for the domain we have configured right now, replacing the
10.10.3.10 with the public address we have used to configure <a class="reference internal" href="god_portal.xhtml#proxyusers"><span class="std std-ref">Users SIP Proxy</span></a>.</p>

<p class="last">Have we stressed enough that without a properly configured DNS
pointing to the Users proxy IP address nothing will work?</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="i-have-no-time-for-a-dns-registry">
<span id="dnshack"></span><h3>I have no time for a DNS registry</h3>
<p>Everything we have said is true: as we create new brands and brands create new
companies, each of them will need a DNS registry.</p>
<p>But the first company of the platform is quite special and can take over the IP
address of the proxy to use it as a domain:</p>
<img alt="../_images/fake_domain.png" src="../_images/fake_domain.png" />
<p>Although it is not a domain, but being used like it was, it will be displayed
in Domain section:</p>

<div class="admonition tip">
<p class="first admonition-title">Tip</p>
<p class="last">It’s important to understand the this trick is only valid for the first
company of the platform ;)</p>

<div class="section" id="remaining-parameters">
<h2>Remaining parameters</h2>
<p>These are remaining relevant parameters configured in Companies section:</p>
<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-name">Name</dt>
<dd>Sets the name for this company.</dd>
<dt id="term-nif">NIF</dt>
<dd>Number used in this company&#8217;s invoices.</dd>
<dt id="term-invoice-data">Invoice data</dt>
<dd>Data included in invoices created by this brand.</dd>
<dt id="term-outbound-prefix">Outbound prefix</dt>
<dd>Some companies are used to dial an aditional prefix for outgoing calls.</dd>
<dt id="term-outgoing-ddi">Outgoing DDI</dt>
<dd>Introduced in 1.3, this setting selects a DDI for outgoing calls
of this company, if it is no overridden in a lower level (e.g. user level)</dd>
<dt id="term-media-relay-set">Media relay set</dt>
<dd>As mentioned above, media-relay can be grouped in sets to reserve capacities
or on a geographical purpose. This section lets you assign them to companies.</dd>
<dt id="term-distribute-method">Distribute Method</dt>
<dd>&#8216;Hash based&#8217; distributes calls hashing a parameter that is unique per
company/retail, &#8216;Round robin&#8217; distributes calls equally between AS-es and
&#8216;static&#8217; is used for debugging purposes.</dd>
<dt id="term-application-server">Application Server</dt>
<dd>If &#8216;static&#8217; <em>distribute method</em> is used, select an application server here.</dd>
<dt id="term-recordings">Recordings</dt>
<dd>Configures a limit for the size of recordings of this company. A
notification is sent to configured address when 80% is reached and
older recordings are rotated when configured size is reached.</dd>
<dt id="term-features">Features</dt>
<dd>Introduced in 1.3, lets brand operator choose the features of the company.
Related sections are hidden consequently and the company cannot use them.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Most of the features are self-explanatory, but <strong>voice notification</strong> deserves
an explanation: if you enable them, when a call fails, the user will listen a
locution explaining what ocurred (&#8220;you have no permissions to place this call&#8221;,
&#8220;the call cannot be billed&#8221;, etc.)</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Recordings rotation happens at two levels: brand and company. This
means that <strong>a company&#8217;s recordings can be rotated even though its limit
has not arrived (or even it has no limit) if brand&#8217;s limit applies first</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition error">
<p class="first admonition-title">Error</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Hint</p>
<p class="last">To avoid this, make sure that the sum of all companies does not exceed
the size assigned to your brand and make sure that all companies has
a size configured (if 0, it has unlimited size).</p>

<p>Both <strong>Distribute method</strong> and <strong>Application Server</strong> are only visible for God
Administrator.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">&#8216;Round-robin&#8217; distribute method is reserved for huge companies/retails

<p>The company emulation process is the same as the brand emulation, with the
