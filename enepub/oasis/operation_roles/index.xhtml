<p>IvozProvider is a multilevel role provider solution.</p>
<p>The following images shows the different available levels and the
relation between them:</p>
<img alt="../_images/operator_levels2.png" src="../_images/operator_levels2.png" />
<p>This section will explain each of the available roles, describing their
responsibilities and more important tasks.</p>
<div class="section" id="global-administator-role">
<h2>Global administator role</h2>
<p>The global administator role (operator in the image) is usually done by
the installation responsible.</p>
<p>All options and platform features are visible to this role and usually is
in charge of its maintenance.</p>
<p>Their most important task is to <strong>create Brands</strong> and configure them so
they have the enough autonomy to properly use the platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Configure their web access.</li>
<li>Configure their brand portal look and feel: themes, colors, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Appart from their main task, their global visibility and total access
makes them responsible of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Monitor the platform so it keeps always UP &amp; RUNNING</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Analyze platform logs to track possible errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Polish the security mechanisms to avoid external attacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Obtain global statistics of calls audio quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Increase the available resources of the platform as long as is needed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Increasing resources available in a standalone installation</li>
<li>Migrating, whenever required, to a distributed installation with multiple
AS, media relays, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, <strong>this role is the only one that has no limits within the
platform</strong>, thats why <em>God</em> is a term used in multiple places along this
documentation.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last"><em>This role is responsible of maintain the platform*</em>, configuring
it for the correct behaviour. This role <strong>doesn&#8217;t have any kind
of limit</strong> and <strong>grants access</strong> to the <strong>brand operators</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brand-andministator-role">
<h2>Brand andministator role</h2>
<p>Brand operator can access a portal with less sections available compared
to the previous role. The general (God) administrator is in charge of
providing an URL with credentials for its brand portal.</p>
<p>The most important task for brand operator can be managed through this
portal: <strong>create and configure companies so they can work properly</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to brand operators are also resposible of billing their companies and
make sure the external cals are properly setup, it must also manage:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Peering contracts with other IP providers for PSTN interconectivity.</li>
<li>Include all required company information for the billing process.</li>
<li>Pricing plans that will offer to their companies, that will determine how
match they pay for each call.</li>
<li>Setup the routes for each outgoing call types based on their final
destination</li>
<li>Create the invoices for each billing period and send them to their
clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the task of brand operator has little in common with the
global operator, but their importance is vital so the final users can use
all the features includes in IvozProvider</p>
<div class="admonition important" id="brand-responsibilities">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last"><strong>To sum up</strong>, the brand operators <strong>grant access</strong> to the
<strong>company</strong> administrators they serve and <strong>configure the

<div class="section" id="company-administator-role">
<h2>Company administator role</h2>
<p>The company administrator has access to the portal supplied by the brand
operator.</p>
<p>From its point of view, it has a virtual pbx in the cloud that must
configure for its users.</p>
<p>To accomplish that, it&#8217;s required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Configure terminals, extensions and users.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Configure the DDI incoming process with the proper logic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">

<li>IVRs</li>
<li>Hunt groups</li>
<li>Faxes</li>
</ul>

<div class="section" id="final-user-role">
<h2>Final user role</h2>
<p>The final user has two different kinds of credentials, both supplied by
its company administator:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>User portal access credetentials</li>
<li>SIP credentials used to register its terminal (or terminals) to IvozProvider</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the user portal, it can browse their call registry and configure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Call forward</li>
<li>Do not disturb</li>
<li>Call waiting</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the SIP creadentials allow the users to configure
their terminal (or terminals) to place and receive calls.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The same SIP credentials can be used in multiple devices at the same
time,generating what is known as <em>parallel-forking</em>: whenever a call is
placed to an user, all the active devices will ring so the user can
answer the call from any of them.</p>
