<span id="id1"></span><h3>Roadwarrior users</h3>
<p>Some companies have roadwarrior users that travel often and connect from external
networks, forcing Companies to disable the IP filter security mechanism.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, there is a user option called <strong>Calls for non-granted IPs</strong>
that enables these users to call from non-granted IPs while their companies are
still protected with IP filter mechanism.</p>
<p>When users like theese call from non-granted IPs, their amount of concurrent
outgoing calls are limited to 1, 2 or 3 to avoid being a security breach.</p>

<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li>There are users that are allowed to make a fixed amount of calls from

<ul class="simple">
<li>If the user is calling from one of the allowed IPs,
it doesn&#8217;t matter if the user is allowed to make calls from non-granted IPs:
this calls are not counted nor limited.</li>
<li>If the user is NOT calling from one of the allowed IPs, it is verified the
amount of calls that this user is allowed to make. If the user is allowed to
make calls from non-granted IPs and has not exceeded his limit, the call is
granted and counted.</li>

<div class="section" id="anti-flooding">
<h2>Anti-flooding</h2>
<p>IvozProvider comes with an <em>anti-flooding</em> mechanism to avoid that a single
sender can deny the platform service by sending lots of requests. Both <em>proxies</em>
(users and trunks) use this mechanism, that <strong>limits the number of requests
from an origin address in a time lapse</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">When an origin reaches this limit, the proxy will stop sending
responses for a period of time. After this time, the requests will be again
handled normally.</p>
</div>
<p>Some origins are automatically excluded from this <em>anti-flooding</em> mechanism:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Application Servers from the platform.</li>
<li>Company authorized IP addresses or ranges (see previous section).</li>
</ul>
<p>Global operator of the platform can also add exceptions to this mechanism in
the section <strong>Global configuration</strong> &gt; <strong>Antiflood trusted IPs</strong>.</p>

<div class="section" id="concurrent-call-limit">
<h2>Concurrent call limit</h2>
<p>This mechanism limits the number of concurrent external calls for a company/retail account. It can also be configured
at brand level.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p class="last">Brand and company/retail limits are not related anyhow. The one that is reached first will prevent new calls.</p>
