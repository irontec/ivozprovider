<h1>Queues</h1>
<p>Easy queue behaviour was included in IvozProvider in 1.3 version. It is a simple
approach with <strong>the unique goal to provide the capability to handle more calls
than users attending them</strong>.</p>

is not a suitable product for callcenters</strong>, as it does not provide
advanced features that are crucial to them (reports, RT visualization,
queue related stat, etc.).</p>

<p><strong>In distributed installations</strong> using Queues is only compatible with an static
