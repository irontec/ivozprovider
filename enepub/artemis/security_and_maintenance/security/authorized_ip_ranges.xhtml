<span id="id1"></span><h2>Roadwarrior users</h2>
<p>Some vPBX clients have roadwarrior users that travel often and connect from external
networks, forcing Clients to disable the IP filter security mechanism.</p>
<p>To solve this issue, there is a user option called <strong>Calls from non-granted IPs</strong>
that enables these users to call from non-granted IPs while remaining users&#8217; credentials
are still protected with IP filter mechanism.</p>
<p>When users like these call from non-granted IPs, their amount of concurrent
outgoing calls are limited to 1, 2 or 3 to avoid being a security breach.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Only <strong>generated calls</strong> (both internals and externals) are limited,
received calls are not affected by this setting.</p>
</div>
<p>To sum up, with this feature:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>There are users that are allowed to make a fixed amount of calls from
non-granted IPs.</li>
<li>These calls from non-granted IPs are counted and limited.</li>
</ul>
<p class="rubric">Example 1 - Client without IP check</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter if the user is allowed to make calls from non-granted IPs,
as there are no non-granted IPs.</p>
<p class="rubric">Example 2 - Client with IP check</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If the user is calling from one of the allowed IPs,
it doesn&#8217;t matter if the user is allowed to make calls from non-granted IPs:
this calls are not counted nor limited.</li>
<li>If the user is NOT calling from one of the allowed IPs, it is verified the
amount of calls that this user is allowed to make. If the user is allowed to
make calls from non-granted IPs and has not exceeded his limit, the call is
granted and counted.</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, if <strong>Calls from non-granted IPs</strong> is set to <em>None</em> the user must fulfill the IP policy of the client.</p>
