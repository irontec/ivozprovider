  <p>Brand operator can access a portal with less sections available compared
to the previous role. The general (God) administrator is in charge of
providing an URL with credentials for its brand portal.</p>
<p>The most important task for brand operator is to <strong>create and configure
clients so they can work properly</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to brand operators are also responsible of billing their clients and
make sure the external calls are properly setup, it must also manage:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Peering contracts with other IP providers for PSTN interconnection.</li>
<li>Include all required client information for the billing process.</li>
<li>Pricing plans that will offer to their clients, that will determine how
match they pay for each call.</li>
<li>Setup the routes for each outgoing call types based on their final
destination</li>
<li>Create the invoices for each billing period and send them to their
clients.</li>
</ul>

global operator, but their importance is vital so the final users can use
all the features includes in IvozProvider</p>
