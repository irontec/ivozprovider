<span id="operation-roles"></span><h1>Platform roles</h1>
<p>IvozProvider is a multilevel role provider solution.</p>
<p>The following images shows the different available levels and the
relation between them:</p>
<img alt="../../_images/operator_levels2.png" src="../../_images/operator_levels2.png" />
<p>This section will explain each of the available roles, describing their
responsibilities and more important tasks.</p>
<div class="section" id="global-administrator-role">
<h2>Global administrator role</h2>
<p>The global administrator role (operator in the image) is usually done by
the installation responsible.</p>
<p>All options and platform features are visible to this role and usually is
in charge of its maintenance.</p>
<p>Their most important task is to <strong>create Brands</strong> and configure them so
they have the enough autonomy to properly use the platform:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Configure their web access.</li>
<li>Configure their brand portal look and feel: themes, colors, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Apart from their main task, their global visibility and total access
makes them responsible of:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Monitor the platform so it keeps always UP &amp; RUNNING</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Analyze platform logs to track possible errors.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Polish the security mechanisms to avoid external attacks.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Obtain global statistics of calls audio quality.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Increase the available resources of the platform as long as is needed:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Increasing resources available in a standalone installation</li>
<li>Migrating, whenever required, to a distributed installation with multiple
AS, media relays, etc.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>To sum up, <strong>this role is the only one that has no limits within the
platform</strong>, that&#8217;s why <em>God</em> is a term used in multiple places along this
documentation.</p>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last"><em>This role is responsible of maintaining the platform*</em>, configuring
it for the correct behaviour. This role <strong>doesn&#8217;t have any kind
of limit</strong> and <strong>grants access</strong> to the <strong>brand operators</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="brand-administrator-role">
<h2>Brand administrator role</h2>
<p>Brand operator can access a portal with less sections available compared
to the previous role. The general (God) administrator is in charge of
providing an URL with credentials for its brand portal.</p>
<p>The most important task for brand operator is to <strong>create and configure
clients so they can work properly</strong>.</p>
<p>Due to brand operators are also responsible of billing their clients and
make sure the external calls are properly setup, it must also manage:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Peering contracts with other IP providers for PSTN interconnection.</li>
<li>Include all required client information for the billing process.</li>
<li>Pricing plans that will offer to their clients, that will determine how
match they pay for each call.</li>
<li>Setup the routes for each outgoing call types based on their final
destination</li>
<li>Create the invoices for each billing period and send them to their
clients.</li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, the task of brand operator has little in common with the
global operator, but their importance is vital so the final users can use
all the features includes in IvozProvider</p>
<div class="admonition important" id="brand-responsibilities">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last"><strong>To sum up</strong>, brand operators <strong>grant access</strong> to their
<strong>clients</strong> administrators and <strong>configure the platform
to route and rate their calls</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="client-administrator-role">
<h2>Client administrator role</h2>
<p>The client administrator has access to the portal supplied by the brand
operator.</p>
<p>From its point of view, it has a virtual pbx in the cloud that must
configure for its users.</p>
<p>To accomplish that, it&#8217;s required:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Configure terminals, extensions and users.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Configure the DDI incoming process with the proper logic:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Directly to an user</li>
<li>IVRs</li>
<li>Hunt groups</li>
<li>Faxes</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Give access to the final users to their web portal, so they can configure
their profile options:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Call forward</li>
<li>Do not disturb</li>
<li>Call waiting</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition important">
<p class="first admonition-title">Important</p>
<p class="last">To sum up, the client administrators are responsible for
<strong>configuring the telephony system and make use of all the
features available in IvozProvider</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="final-user-role">
<h2>Final user role</h2>
<p>The final user has two different kinds of credentials, both supplied by
its client administrator:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>User portal access credentials</li>
<li>SIP credentials used to register terminals to IvozProvider</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the user portal, it can browse their call registry and configure:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Call forward</li>
<li>Do not disturb</li>
<li>Call waiting</li>
<li>Displayed data when calling</li>
<li>Geographical configuration</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, the SIP credentials allow users to configure their terminals to place and receive calls.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">The same SIP credentials can be used in multiple devices at the same
time,generating what is known as <em>parallel-forking</em>: whenever a call is
placed to an user, all the active devices will ring so the user can
answer the call from any of them.</p>
