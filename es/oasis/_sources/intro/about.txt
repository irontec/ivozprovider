About this document
*******************

This document describes the process of installation and usage of
IvozProvider, the multi-tenant telephony platform for providers developed
by `Irontec <http://irontec.com>`_.

This should be the starting point for anyone interested in this solution,
both  from the technical point of view and the user one and it's divided
in four blocks:

 - The first block is about :ref:`concepts` where each element of the
   product and its main function is decscribed.

 - The second block describes the :ref:`installation` process with a fresh
   installed platform, leaving the deep configuration details for the next
   block.

 - The third block goes deeper into the most :ref:`advanced` features like
   **trarification, billing, PBX advanced options and every call details**
   that were omitted in the previous block.

 - The fourth and last block describes the :ref:`security` measures that
   implements the solution.
