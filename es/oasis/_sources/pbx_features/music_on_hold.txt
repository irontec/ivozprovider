Music on Hold
#############

The music on hold will be played when the user holds the call and the other 
member waits until the call is resumed. 

IvozProvider can be configured at two levels what music will be played:

- At brand level: **Brand Configuration** > **Generic Music on Hold**

- At company level: **Company Configuration** > **Music on Hold**

If a company has defined a music on hold, it will be played. Otherwise, the 
one defined by the brand administrator. If none of this is configured, a global 
music will be played.

.. note:: Multiple files can be added to be played as Music on Hold. The system 
   will choose them randomly for each call. 

.. rubric:: Add a new music on hold

Once the music has been *encoded* the **Status** fill will display *ready* and 
the music will be used for the next calls.

.. tip:: IvozProvider supports most of the common audio formats and *encodes* 
   them to the optimal format for the platform. 

After the *encoding*, we can download both the original and the converted 
version in the edit screen.
