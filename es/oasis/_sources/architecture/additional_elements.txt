IvozProvider has multiple elements that are not exposed to the *external world*
but play a crucial task.

The most remarkable profile is **database profile** that gathers all the
information of the platform and shares it between the majority of software packaged.
IvozProvider uses `MySQL database engine <https://www.mysql.com/>`_ for this task.

Another remarkable task is **asychronous tasks handler**: CDR must be parsed,
calls must be billed, recordings must be encoded, etc.
