Client Configuration
********************

We're close to make our fist call in our fresh installed IvozProvider, there
are only 6 steps to configure in our DemoClient virtual pbx.

- 2 terminals
- 2 extensions
- 2 users

Creating Terminals
==================

Go to the terminal section and... voil√†! We already have 2 terminals created.

Creating Extensions
===================

Then we go to extensions, just to check that we have 2 extensions already
created for us.

Nothing more to do in this section, let's go the next one!

Creating Users
==============

As expected, we also have 2 created users with previous extensions and terminals assigned.

At this point, we have everything ready make a call between this two users: Alice and Bob.
