Invoice number sequences
########################

In order to allow programming automatic invoice generation using :ref:`Invoice schedulers` section, invoice
numbers must be created using a defined sequence number.

This section allows brand operator to create as many sequences as needed filling these fields:

.. glossary::

    Name
        Used for referencing this sequence in Invoice generation window.

    Prefix
        Prepended in any number generated by this sequence.

    Sequence length
        Zeroes will be prepended to enforce this length.

    Increment
        Units between subsequent invoice numbers.

.. note:: Invoice number sequences are mandatory for scheduled invoices and optional for manual invoices.

.. rubric:: Example (prefix: TEST, sequence length: 4, increment: 1)

Generated sequence numbers will be: TEST0001, TEST0002, TEST0003 and so on.

.. tip:: **Latest value** field shows the value of last invoice number that used a given sequence.
