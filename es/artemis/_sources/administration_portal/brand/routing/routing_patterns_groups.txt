Routing pattern groups
**********************

As we will see in :ref:`Outgoing Routings` section, every routing
pattern will be linked to a Carrier.

That's why it can be useful to group the :ref:`Routing patterns` in **routing pattern groups**
so that we can use a whole group in a routing rule.

By default we can see the countries grouped in the continents defined in
`ISO 3166 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166>`_.

.. tip:: Brand operator can choose between keeping this routing pattern groups if
         finds them useful or deleting them an creating the ones that meet his needs.
