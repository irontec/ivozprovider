Brand administrators can configure the notifications sent by IvozProvider:

- Email sent when a new voicemail is received

- Email sent when a new fax is received

- Email sent when a balance is below configured threshold

- Email sent when an automatic invoice is generated

- Email sent when scheduled CDR CSVs are generated

- Email sent when max daily usage is reached

This section allows **modifying default templates** that will be **used when no custom notification is configured**.

See :ref:`notification_templates` for further reference.
