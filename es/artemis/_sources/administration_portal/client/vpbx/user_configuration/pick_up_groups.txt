Call pickup is the process where a user can answer a call that is being ringing 
in another terminal. No need to say that, somehow (sound, flashing lights,
notification, etc) the users must know that the call is ringing elsewhere. 

IvozProvider supports two kind of call pickups:

.. glossary::

    Direct pickup
        In this type of pickup, the user that is trying to capture the ringing 
        call must include the extension of the target phone after the service 
        code. For example, if the direct pickup code is \*95, the user must 
        dial \*95101 to capture a call that is ringing in the extension 101.        

    Group pickup
        In this type of pickup, the user that is trying to capture the ringing
        call will just dial the service code. If anyone in any of the pickup
        groups of the user has a ringing call, it will be answered by the 
        capturer.

******************
Call pickup groups
******************

In order to make **call group pickups**, the capturer user must be part of the 
same group that the target user that wants to capture.

The section **Pickup groups** allows the client administrator to configure 
what users will be in each group:


As shown in the section :ref:`users`, we can add or edit the groups of a user
in the user's edit screen. 
 
.. note:: A user can be part of multiple pickup groups. The system will take
   all of them into account when using the group pickup service.

Group pickup service code

IvozProvider supports 2 different configuration levels for defining the service
codes for pickup:

- At brand level: **Brand configuration** > **Services**.

- At client level: **Client configuration** > **Services**.

The brand administrator can configure generic codes that all the clients will 
use. Clients can customize this codes if they are used to another ones.

The :ref:`following section <services>` explains the services in depth, with 
all the additional services that can be accessed by dialing codes starting with 
\*.
