Create a new carrier
####################

At this point of the configuration, we have to configure IvozProvider to receive
calls using a DDI Provider, but we have not configured a Carrier to make external call.

.. tip:: VoIP Providers will usually provide both services: making and receiving calls.

Configure a Carrier in a similar way we configured the DDI Provider (further instructions :ref:`here <Carriers>`),
assigning it the same numeric transformation set.
