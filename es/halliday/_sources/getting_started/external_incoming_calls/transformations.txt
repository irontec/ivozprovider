Transformations configuration

**IvozProvider** is designed to provide service **anywhere in the planet**, not
only the original country where the platform is installed.

A very important concept to achieve this goal are the numeric transformations,
that **adapts the different number format systems of the countries of the world**
defined in `E.164 <https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-E.164/es>`_ **to a neutral
format**.

The section that allows the brand operator to configure all the **numeric
transformations** is **Brand Configuration / Providers / Numeric transformations**.

You can find more information about transformations in :ref:`Numeric transformations` section.

.. tip:: We already have a pre-created set for most of the countries of the world, so hopefully nothing needs to be done here.
