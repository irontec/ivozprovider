About this documentation
************************

This documentation describes the process of installation and usage of
IvozProvider, the multi-tenant telephony platform for providers developed
by `Irontec <http://irontec.com>`_.

This should be the starting point for anyone interested in this solution,
both from the technical point of view and the user one and it's divided
in multiple sections from the basic infrastructure information and configuration
to the final user settings.
