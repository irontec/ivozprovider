Making internal calls
#####################

The goal of this block will be to configure IvozProvider in order to make
internal calls, using as the starting point the base installation described
in the previous step.

In order to achieve making a call between Alice and Bob, we have to fulfill some tasks in
the three configuration levels described in :ref:`operation_roles`.

That's why we have ordered the index in these 3 blocks:

    god_portal
    brand_portal
    client_portal
    configure_sipuacs
