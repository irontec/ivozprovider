Locutions
#########

The locutions of the platform are created and uploaded just like the files of  
:ref:`Music on Hold <musiconhold>`.

The section **Client configuration** > **Locutions**  allows the client admin 
to choose the sounds that will be played in many configuration places (IVR, etc)
accross the platform.


.. attention:: Locutions can be recorded from any terminal by dialing the
   Recording extension displayed in their edit screen.

.. hint:: The main difference between a **locution** and **music on hold** is 
   that the administrator chooses when the first one will be played (out of 
   schedule, IVRs, and so on) and the second one will be played when a call is
   held by an user.
