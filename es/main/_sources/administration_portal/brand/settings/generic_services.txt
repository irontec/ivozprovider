Call forward services
=====================

Call forward services (unconditional, no answer, busy and unreachable) are **only available for residential clients**
and allow adding **call forward to national phone numbers and to voicemail**.

All residential **clients within a brand use the same codes** to access to this feature, those defined in this section.

.. note:: Call forward to numbers outside company's country is not supported using services codes.
             Use web portal instead.

service code followed by destination number. This will create and enable (or modify if already exists one) a call
forward of given type to that national number.

To enable a call forward of a given type to forward calls to voicemail, residential device must call to defined
service code followed by '*'. This will create and enable (or modify if already exists one) a call
forward of given type to voicemail.
