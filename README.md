Ivoz Provider is a multitenant solution for VoIP telephony providers designed for horizontal scaling and load balancing.

## Features
#### Multitenancy
IvozProvider supports multiple management levels, from Global platform administrator to final user, each of them having its own web interface with visibility to perform configuration tasks.

 * Global Administrator manages multiple Brands
 * Brand Administrators manage multiple Companies
 * Company Administrators manage multiple Users
 * Users manage their preferences

#### Scaling
From its beginning, IvozProvider was designed to be installed distributed between multiple machines, each one fullfilling one of the existing profiles:

 * Proxy:
   - Provides **SIP communication** with Providers and Users terminals
   - Provides **media relay** between endpoints
   - Powered by [Kamailo SIP Server 4.4](https://www.kamailio.org/w/)

 * Portal:
   - Provides **Web interfaces** for all platform roles
   - Access to all Bussiness data and shared files through **Rest API** services
   - Management interfaces powered by [Klear Framework](https://www.irontec.com/internet/klear)
   - User interface powered by [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/)

 * Application Server:
   - Provides **PBX features** and runs configured logics
   - Powered by [Asterisk 13 LTS](http://www.asterisk.org/) with [PJSIP](http://www.pjsip.org/) channel driver
   - Logics implemented in PHP using fastagi AGI

 * Data:
   - Provides database and shared storage for the rest of machines
   - Powered by [MySQL 5.5 Server](http://www.mysql.com/)

And [many others](https://irontec.github.io/ivozprovider/en/intro/what_is_inside.html) open source projects.

Bear in mind that, while at least one of each profile must be installed for the platform to work, there can be multiple machines of each profile and all of them can also be installed in the same machine (a.k.a. standalone installation).

#### Cloud Service
IvozProvider is designed to work directly from the Internet. Although it can be used in local environments, being exposed to the public network [has it's advantages](https://irontec.github.io/ivozprovider/es/intro/what_is_ivozprovider.html#expuesta-a-la-red-publica)

## Installation

There are [several ways](https://irontec.github.io/ivozprovider/en/installation) to install IvozProvider.
